                    I'm a web developer living near Portland, Oregon.
                    I am passionate about building products that allow people to spend
                    more time doing the things they love, and more time with each other.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prior to work as a dev, I've worked as a caterer, framed houses,
                    ran a warehouse, slung lattes, and built fences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy reading, rock climbing, weightlifitng, building questionably useful household furniture,
                    and thinking about the far future of humanity.

                  <h2>TheMall, built @ EyeCue Lab</h2>
                  <p>
                    TheMall was a social shopping destination, integrating hundreds of consumers
                    favorite brands under one roof. TheMall is designed for an online window-shopping
                    experience, much like strolling through a physical mall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    TheMall was built on a microservices architecture, with a RestifyJS + MongoDB backend
                    talking JSONAPI to a KoaJS and plain jQuery frontend. I was the main frontend developer
                    for this site, and built a static mock in ExpressJS, then built the final reenvisioned frontend
                    out after the client had a design pivot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The dev version is visible at <a href="http://mall-dev.eyecue.io">mall-dev.eyecue.io</a>

                  <h2>Powur, built @ EyeCue Lab</h2>
                  <p>
                    Power is a network marketing solar sales web app built atop SolarCity's physical
                    API for acquiring customers. Users sign up under other users, send proposals to other people,
                    and earn commissions if those individuals follow through and place solar on their property.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Powur is built on Rails with Postgres, and Angular 1.4 in TypeScript. I worked on this project for two
                    months, building out custom endpoints and Angular components for users to easily view their
                    personal sales statistics.

                  <h2>Wagick, built @ EyeCue Lab</h2>
                  <p>
                    Wagick was my intern project at EyeCue Lab, and is a word game inspired by Scrabble and every RPG ever.
                    The goal of the game is to spell words, depending on the color of the tiles
                    that you used to spell the word, you will either damage the opponent, gain experience,
                    or recieve gold.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wagick was built with Rails, Postgres, and plain jQuery. It has server and client-side
                    checking on action allowability, and a fun set of graphics and animations.
